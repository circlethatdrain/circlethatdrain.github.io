Circle That Drain!
==================
I've decided to try running my own website as a means of getting better with various technologies, and also to have a place to put my writing where others _can_ see it but most _won't_. If you're wondering why I don't use a blogging platform like a sensible person would, well... I don't have a good answer for that. Sorry.
